This project was started in the fall of 2018 in order to have some Halloween fun and leverage an underworked PI with an overpowered sound output.  When connected (improperly) to the amp it provided good (but because imporperly not loud enough) fun.

In 2019 I added support for playback locally, cribbed from another project (http://billpollock.com/boo) I hope to wrap in here.  Because really, this world needs more random screaming but I think there needs to be some filtering/content control because a few of those are a little too blood-curdling to commit to.  Several layers need to be added and then we can call it a multi-purpose soundboard timewaster and a day.

Because, really, gotta fold in /boo and then who knows what past that?  Maybe those old Duke Nukem WAVs.
